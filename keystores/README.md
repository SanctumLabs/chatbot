# Keystores

This is where you will store the keys used for creating a releas apk and also for enabling automatic publishing to Playstore.

Refer to this [article](https://github.com/codepath/android_guides/wiki/Automating-Publishing-to-the-Play-Store) for automated deployments to PlayStore.

After getting the keys you need from Google Developer Console, rename the json key to `chatbot_publish_key.json` an `chatbot_publish_key.p12` for the P12 key.

Ensure you also have the keystore.properties file saved in this folder.

DO NOT push your keys to a VCS!
